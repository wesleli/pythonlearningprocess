# Python For Beginners - Python 3 Guide - Excercises

This is repository will be part of my Phyton learning process.

A future project demand me knowledge of the python language. So i choose the help of the book Python For Beginners - Python 3 Guide by Timothy C. Needham for my first contact to phyton.

The book has a series of practical excercises which I pretend upload to this repository and make some notes of learning process.
